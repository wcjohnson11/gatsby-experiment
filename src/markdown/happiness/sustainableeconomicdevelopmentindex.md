<h3>Sustainable Economic Development Index</h3>
<p>
   The <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/interactives/seda-2018-guide.aspx">Sustainable Economic Development Index</a> is a method for gaining insight into a countries social and economic conditions. SEDI is built on ten dimensions across three categories, Economics (Income, Economic Stability and Employment), Investments (Education, Health, Infrastructure) and Sustainability (Environment, Equality, Civil Society and Government Effectiveness).

    European countries make up the top 71% of SEDI scores in 2018, largely thanks to their high income levels and investments in social progress and governance. Signapore is the only non-European nation in the top ten. Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the UK and the US are the only G20 countries in the SEDA top 20.
