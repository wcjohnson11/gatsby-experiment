<h3>World Happiness Report Score</h3>
<p>
    The World Happiness Report uses data from the Gallup World Poll question focusing on life evaluation, called the Cantril ladder. In this question, respondents rate their lives on a scale of 0 to 10 where 10 is the best possible life and 0 is the worst.

<br />
<p>
    The World Happiness Report then focuses its country scores on the feeling of happiness, which is a combination of the emotional and fulfillment aspects of happiness. This makes this measurement unique in that it is focused first and foremost on happiness.

<p>
    In recent releases of the Happiness Report, they have analyzed six factors, GDP, life expectancy, generosity, social support, freedom and corruption for each country to try to explain the answers to the Cantril Ladder. These factors aren't used in the creation of the scores in this report but show what the authors think of as important to human happiness and well-being and what might explain why some countries rank higher than others.
