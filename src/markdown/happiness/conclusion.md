### Conclusion

We are in the nascent stages of finding the best method for measuring well-being and even earlier in making policy decisions based on that data. As we begin to learn more about human well-being and how we can maximize it, we can learn how to create more human friendly systems and policies.

On a community level, it's important to look at both objective and subjective measures of well-being when trying to address the issues we face.

On a personal level, it's important to be more aware of what makes us happy and try to bring more of that out into our lives. Happiness is not just the opposite of negative emotions but a collection of various dimensions that can and should be cultivated.

>The pursuit of happiness lies at the core of human endeavors. People around the world aspire to lead happy and fulfilling lives free from fear and want, and in harmony with nature,Yet, basic material wellbeing is still elusive for far too many living in extreme poverty.

>For many more, recurring socio-economic crises, violence and crime, environmental degradation and increasing threats of climate change are an ever-present threat.
