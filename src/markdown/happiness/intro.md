### What is well-being

Well-being is a very broad concept used to refer to a quality of life that is comprised two major spheres, objective and subjective. 

**Objective well-being** is comprised of things like the level of education, economic stability and sufficiency, the standard of living, safety from crime and war, health and life expectancy, social services and infrastructure.

**Subjective well-being** is different in that it is based on an individuals subjective assessment of the quality of their life. This generally includes factors such as a sense that a person's life has meaning, that they are growing as individuals, that they are in control of their life, that they have community and feel happy or optimistic about the future. A person's experience of subjective well-being is informed by their culture and life experiences and so it is more difficult to measure.

For example, when psychologist [Sonja
Lyubomirsky]("https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143114956") did a research project asking people in America and Russia to define happiness, Americans commonly said money, family, success and having fun while Russian people said spiritual salvation, a world of peace and beauty and mutual understanding among people.

### Why Measuring well-being can create a better world

If we can understand the building blocks of well-being, then we can create policies that target them, creating conditions where there are less obstructions to subjective well-being.

By measuring well-being we can analyze the impact of different policies on well-being, observing trends in countries' historical well-being and compare them against other countries. Increasing quality of life should be a key focus for all governments and the more we attempt to measure and improve well-being, the more we will learn about how to measure and improve well-being which should lead to better quality of life outcomes.

### The history of measuring human well-being

Global efforts to measure human well-being are still relatively new. After World War 2 and the Great Depression, when
countries were attempting to find ways to measure their
recoveries, economist Simon Kuznets developed the concept of Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) to capture all economic production by
individuals, companies and the government in a single statistic. He
theorized that it should correlate to well-being since it would rise in good times and fall in bad.

The linechart below allows you to observe countries GDP per capita(adjusted for inflation and Purchasing Power Parity) over time since 1950. You can add or remove countries using the select bar to inspect specific countries' GDP.
