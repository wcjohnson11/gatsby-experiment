### What is well-being

Well-being is a very broad concept used to refer to a quality of life that is comprised two major spheres, objective and subjective. 

**Objective well-being** is comprised of things like the level of education, economic stability and sufficiency, the standard of living, safety from crime and war, health and life expectancy, social services and infrastructure.

**Subjective well-being** is different in that it is based on an individuals subjective assessment of the quality of their life. This generally includes factors such as a sense that a person's life has meaning, that they are growing as individuals, that they are in control of their life, that they have community and feel happy or optimistic about the future.

### Why Measuring well-being can create a better world

If we can understand the building blocks of well-being, then we can measure them and create policies with the aim of increasing objective well-being and create societies where people are more likely to feel subjective well-being.

By measuring well-being we can also see the results of different policies and compare countries to their past performance and against other countries in these well-being indicators. Having a focus on increasing the quality of life should be a key focus of our governments and the more we attempt to measure and improve well-being, the more we will learn about how to measure and improve well-being which will hopefully lead to a better world.

### The history of measuring human well-being

The history of attempting to measure human well-being on a global scale
is still relatively new. After World War 2 and the Great Depression,
when countries were attempting to find ways to measure their
recoveries, economist Simon Kuznets developed the concept of a Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) to capture all economic production by
individuals, companies and the government in a single statistic. He
theorized that it should correlate to well-being since it would rise in good times and fall in bad.

This was easily measurable and served as the primary measure of a
country's well-being for many years but over time, criticism arose that
growth in a country's economic output doesn't necessarily mean a
better life for it's citizens.

The linechart below allows you to observe countries GDP per capita(adjusted for inflation and Purchasing Power Parity) over time since 1950. You can add or remove countries using the select bar to inspect specific countries' GDP.
