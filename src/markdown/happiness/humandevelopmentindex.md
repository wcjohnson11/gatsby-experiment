<h3>Human Development Index</h3>
<p>
    The Human Development Index was created by the <a href="http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-index-hdi">United Nations Development Program</a> in 1990 as a way to measure the potential of people across different countries according to three key dimensions, life expectancy, education and earning potential. The HDI is not meant to include all of the factors of human development and well-being, it is meant to stimulate debate around policy priorities pertaining to its three key dimensions.

    Their reasoning is that if a person's basic needs are met by living longer, having more education and earning more money, their quality of life should be better. In Norway, the country with the highest HDI, a child born today can expect to live at least 82 years and spend 18 years in school while a child born in Niger, the country with lowest HDI can expect to live to 60 and spend 5 years in school.

    Norway, Switzerland, Australia, Ireland and Germany lead the HDI ranking while Niger, the Central African Republic, South Sudan, Chad and Burundi have the lowest scores in health, education and income. The biggest declines in HDI were countries in conflict, Syria, Yemen and Libya. The Human Development Index has been trending up globally, with more countries increasing life expectancy, education and development since the Index has started to be measured. Over the past five years, life expectancy has increased almost 7 years globally with Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia making the biggest gains.
