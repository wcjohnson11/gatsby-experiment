<h3>Happy Planet Index</h3>
<p>
    The Happy Planet Index was created by the <a href="http://www.neweconomics.org/">New Economics Foundation</a>, the UK's leading think tank promoting social, economic and environmental justice. They devised the Happy Planet Index in hopes of shaping the economies of the world to be better for people and the environment. The Happy Planet Index is calculated according to four key metrics, wellbeing, life expectancy, inequality and ecological footprint. The exact methodology is broken down in their <a href="http://happyplanetindex.org/s/Methods-paper_2016-48te.pdf">Methods Paper.</a>

    They claim that GDP growth as a central aim of governments has led to political conditions where politicians are more likely to try and deliver short term GDP growth to insure reelection. This type of strategy unfortunately has led to deteriorating social conditions, growing inequalities and an inability to deal with Climate Change. Western Nations are often regarded as having the highest GDP and standard of living but Latin American and nations in the Asia Pacific region have the highest Happy Planet Index by achieving higher life expectancies, high wellbeing and a much lower ecological footprint.

    The Happy Planet Index aims to create an average view of wellbeing in a given conuntry but it fails to account for some factors, such as Human Rights Violations. Human Rights Violations are typically only visited up minorities in a given country and so their experiences are likely to make a small affect on wellbeing in a nation when measured in this way.
