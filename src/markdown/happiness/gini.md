<h3>GINI Index</h3>
<p>
    One of the oldest measurements of wellbeing is The GINI index,
    developed by Italian Statistician Corrado Gini in 1912, measures
    inequality in income distribution in family income, with 0
    representing perfect equality (everyone earns exactly the same) and 1
    representing perfect inequality (one family earns everything, everyone
    else earns nothing). The GINI index is an imperfect measurement
    because it focuses on income, rather than wealth, which is much harder
    to measure because of unreliable GDP and income data. Shadow economies
    and tax havens make it hard to measure income and wealth, particularly
    in developing countries. Despite this, it appears to be fairly well
    correlated to GDP per capita, meaning that countries with a higher GDP
    per capita tend to have less inequality, at least as far as it is measured here.
