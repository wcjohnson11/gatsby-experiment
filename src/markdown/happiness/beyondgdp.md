### Beyond GDP, New Metrics for Measuring Well-Being

**GDP** is relatively easy to measure and served as the primary measure of a country's well-being for many years. While economic growth and wealth is a vital component of well-being, it's too simplistic to capture the entirety of it.

It is necessary to create multi-faceted metrics in order to better understand well-being, create policy that will improve it and avoid and reform policies that will degrade it.

Several individuals and groups have developed metrics for measuring well-being. The differences between these metrics show what these individuals and groups consider to be most important for well-being. Most of these metrics focus on objective well-being because the data is more easily measured and modeled.

Of the metrics analyzed here, **Happy Planet Index** and **World Happiness Report Score** are the only ones to measure subjective well-being.They take responses to the World Gallup Poll survey question that asks people to rank their happiness on a scale of zero to 10.The **HPI** is a composite of subjective well-being and objective well-being metrics while the **WHRS** is purely a measurement of subjective well-being.

- **The GINI Index (GINI)** measures inequality in distribution of family income
- **The Happy Planet Index (HPI)** measures a combination of well-being, health/life expectancy, inequality and ecologicaly footprint
- **The Human Development Index (HDI)** measures health/life expectancy, standard of living, amount of education received
- **The Sustainable Economic Development Assessment (SEDA)** focuses on Economic factors, Investments in Social Services like education, health and infrastructure and Sustainability.
- **The World Happiness Report Score (WHPR)** measures people's experiences of the quality of their lives
