### Beyond GDP

In 1990, UN economist Mahbub ul Haq created the Human Development
Index (HDI) to more accurately measure human wellbeing, which focused
on education, health expectancy, gender equality, and standard of
living. In 2012, UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon recognized the
importance of making happiness a goal of public policy.

### What is Happiness anyway?

<blockquote>
    <p>
    Happiness is the experience of joy, contentment, or positive
    well-being, combined with a sense that oneâ€™s life is good,
    meaningful, and worthwhile.

This definition clearly separates happiness into two main parts, the
first, happiness as positive emotions such as joy, contentment,
interest and love and the second, as an evaluation of human wellbeing,
a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction that comes from living a good
life.

The emotional aspect is universal while the second depends on a
person's culture and life experiences. For example, when Sonja
Lyubomirsky did a research project asking people in America and Russia
to define happiness,American people said money, family, success,
having fun while Russian people said spiritual salvation, a world of
peace and beauty, mutual understanding among people.

Happiness is difficult to measure but if there is a strong
correllation between happiness and quality of life, then if we can
find a way to model happiness in a society, then we can measure it's
quality of life, observe changes over time, refine our models and
maximize for policies that lead to more happiness and avoid policies
that lead to less happiness.

### Metrics for Measuring Wellbeing

Several groups have developed metrics for measuring wellbeing in a country. The differences between thesemetrics represent the different ideas of how to measure a country's quality of life in comparison to others and to itself over time as well as what should be focused on in policy to improve the quality of life.

- **The GINI Index** measures inequality in distribution of family income
- **The Happy Planet Index** measures a combination of wellbeing, health/life expectancy, inequality and ecologicaly footprint
- **The Human Development Index** measures health/life expectancy, standard of living, amount of education received
- **The Sustainable Economic Development Assessment** focuses on Economic factors, Investments in Social Services like education, health and infrastructure and Sustainability.
- **The World Happiness Report Score** measures people's experiences of the quality of their lives

See the below legend for a visual representation of what each metric measures.
