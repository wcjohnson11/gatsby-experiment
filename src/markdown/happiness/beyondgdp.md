### Beyond GDP

GDP is relatively easy to measure and served as the primary measure of a country's well-being for many years but over time, criticism arose that growth in a country's economic output doesn't necessarily mean a better life for it's citizens. While increased economic production should lead to some increased objective and subjective well-being, it relies too heavily on economic output by ignoring the rest of the building blocks of objective and subjective well-being. The inability fully capture the complexities of objective and subjective well-being hinders attempts to understand and create policy to improve well-being.

In 1990, UN economist Mahbub ul Haq created the Human Development
Index (HDI) to more accurately measure human well-being, which focused
on education, health expectancy, gender equality, and standard of
living. In 2012, UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon recognized the
importance of making happiness a goal of public policy.

### Metrics for Measuring Well-being

Several groups have developed metrics for measuring well-being in a country, most of them focus on objective well-being because the data is more readily available. The differences between these metrics represent the different ideas of how to measure a country's quality of life in comparison to others and to itself over time as well as what should be focused on in policy to improve the quality of life.

- **The GINI Index** measures inequality in distribution of family income
- **The Happy Planet Index** measures a combination of well-being, health/life expectancy, inequality and ecologicaly footprint
- **The Human Development Index** measures health/life expectancy, standard of living, amount of education received
- **The Sustainable Economic Development Assessment** focuses on Economic factors, Investments in Social Services like education, health and infrastructure and Sustainability.
- **The World Happiness Report Score** measures people's experiences of the quality of their lives
